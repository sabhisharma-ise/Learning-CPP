Declaration is promise, defining of function is fulfilling of that promise. 
You can directly define it (that means you are doing both at same time). 
But if you try use function before declaring it, it will be compilation 
error.

Caller should know prototype of callee. That's it.

i.e. The Calling Function should know prototype of Called Function.
